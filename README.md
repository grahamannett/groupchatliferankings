# groupchatliferankings
twice weekly ranking for members of group chat

### plan of how to use (should be ideally all run from personal remote server)
1. should copy files from current Library chat.db area with rsync
2. sql query with latest dates (once latest date works correctly)
3. create metric and post to twitter for group to see

#### why?
- create quantifiable metric of who's life is the best in group chat
- long term metrics of group chat (group has been around in some form for over 2 years now, would be interesting to see stuff about)


### goals/plans: 
1. post most frequently reposted messages/images
2. post the worst/best messages of the week
3. ???
4. profit
